# Optimal Market for Advertising E-Learning Products

This project identifies the most promising markets for an e-learning company offering online courses in **web development, mobile development, data science**, and related fields. Through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, I evaluate global trends in programming interest, learner demographics, and purchasing behavior to recommend strategic regions for targeted advertising investment.


## Project Objectives

* Analyze **geographical distribution** of new coders worldwide
* Identify regions with **high willingness to pay** for monthly subscriptions
* Align regional interests with the company's **course offerings**
* Assess **English accessibility** and learner preferences
* Understand **demographic and professional profiles** of the user base

## Key Findings

* **United States** is the most promising market due to its large user base and strong willingness to pay.
* **India** offers high potential, with a large, engaged audience and price tolerance exceeding the target subscription fee.
* **Canada** shows strong per-user spending but has a significantly smaller audience.

### Ad Budget Allocation Recommendation:

* **80%** — United States
* **13%** — India
* **7%** — Canada
  

### Target Audience Characteristics:

* Majority age group: **25–30 years**
* Gender: Predominantly **male**
